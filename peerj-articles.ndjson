This paper concludes our series of publications comparing island and mainland speciation in European butterfly-orchids, by studying the morphology, phylogenetics and reproductive biology of the controversial circum-arctic species Platanthera (Limnorchis) hyperborea\u2014the most frequent of seven Icelandic orchids. We draw particular attention to its phylogenetic placement, remarkable reproductive biology and morphological convergence on other Platanthera lineages through floral miniaturisation.Methods. Five populations of P. hyperborea in southwest Iceland were measured for 33 morphological characters and subjected to detailed multivariate and univariate analyses, supported by light and scanning electron microscopy of selected flowers. Representative samples from six populations were sequenced for nrITS and placed in a taxonomically broader phylogenetic matrix derived from previous studies.Key Results . Section Limnorchis consists of three distinct ITS-delimited clades based on P. stricta, P. sparsifolia\u2013limosa\u2013aquilonis and P. dilatata\u2013hyperborea. Within the latter group, supposed species boundaries overlap; instead, the data indicate a crude stepwise series of ribotypic transitions extending eastward from North America to Iceland. Morphometric data failed to identify any taxonomically meaningful partitions among Icelandic P. hyperborea populations, despite the presence of a distinct and apparently plesiomorphic ribotype at the most glacially influenced habitat sampled. Microscopic study of the flowers revealed several distinguishing features (some not previously reported), including resupinate lateral sepals, toothed bract margins, club-shaped papillae shared by both the interior of the labellar spur and the stigmatic surface, and an exceptionally adhesive stigma that is reliably covered in disaggregated pollen masses prior to anthesis; auricles are absent.Conclusions. Ribotypes suggest that Icelandic P. hyperborea represents the terminus of a migration route that may have begun in East Asia before passing through North America and presumably Greenland. The incohesive pollinia, rapidly desiccating anther locules, weakly developed rostellum, exceptionally adhesive stigma and the close juxtaposition of compact male and female reproductive organs together conspire to cause routine autogamy and frequent cleistogamy, despite the continued production of substantial nectar reservoirs in the spur and consequent ongoing attraction to the flowers of insects, including mosquitoes. When considered in combination with independently derived lineages of Platanthera on the Azorean and Hawaiian archipelagos also bearing small green flowers, our observations show allometric and paedomorphic reductions in flower size as the primary evolutionary driver, but also indicate strong developmental and functional constraints.","description-html":"<p><b>Background and Aims<\/b>.

Moreover, the independent contribution of main-chain contact density measures and RSA are negligible. Thus, as predicted by the stress theory, site-specific evolutionary rates are determined by side-chain packing.<\/p>","title-html":"Too packed to change: side-chain packing and site-specific substitution rates in protein evolution","subjects":["Biophysics","Computational Biology","Evolutionary Studies","Mathematical Biology"],"identifiers":{"peerj":"911","pubmed":null,"pmc":null},"@context":"http:\/\/static.peerj.com\/context\/citation\/context.json","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ScholarlyArticle","@id":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911","_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.json"},"alternate":{"html":{"type":"text\/html","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.html"},"xml":{"type":"application\/xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.xml"},"pdf":{"type":"application\/pdf","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.pdf"},"rdf":{"type":"application\/rdf+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.rdf"},"ris":{"type":"application\/x-research-info-systems","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.ris"},"bib":{"type":"application\/x-bibtex","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.bib"},"unixref":{"type":"application\/unixref+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.unixref"},"datacite":{"type":"application\/datacite+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.datacite"},"citeproc":{"type":"application\/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/911.citeproc"}}}}

We draw particular attention to its phylogenetic placement, remarkable reproductive biology and morphological convergence on other Platanthera lineages through floral miniaturisation.Methods. Five populations of P. hyperborea in southwest Iceland were measured for 33 morphological characters and subjected to detailed multivariate and univariate analyses, supported by light and scanning electron microscopy of selected flowers.

Section Limnorchis consists of three distinct ITS-delimited clades based on P. stricta, P. sparsifolia\u2013limosa\u2013aquilonis and P. dilatata\u2013hyperborea.

Microscopic study of the flowers revealed several distinguishing features (some not previously reported), including resupinate lateral sepals, toothed bract margins, club-shaped papillae shared by both the interior of the labellar spur and the stigmatic surface, and an exceptionally adhesive stigma that is reliably covered in disaggregated pollen masses prior to anthesis; auricles are absent.Conclusions. Ribotypes suggest that Icelandic P. hyperborea represents the terminus of a migration route that may have begun in East Asia before passing through North America and presumably Greenland. The incohesive pollinia, rapidly desiccating anther locules, weakly developed rostellum, exceptionally adhesive stigma and the close juxtaposition of compact male and female reproductive organs together conspire to cause routine autogamy and frequent cleistogamy, despite the continued production of substantial nectar reservoirs in the spur and consequent ongoing attraction to the flowers of insects, including mosquitoes. When considered in combination with independently derived lineages of Platanthera on the Azorean and Hawaiian archipelagos also bearing small green flowers, our observations show allometric and paedomorphic reductions in flower size as the primary evolutionary driver, but also indicate strong developmental and functional constraints.","description-html":"<p><b>Background and Aims<\/b>.

Narnaviruses are known only in fungi, and the origin of plant mitochondrial mitovirus NERVEs appears to be horizontal transfer from plant pathogenic fungi.

We sampled sticklebacks from 17 sites in north-western Europe in this first extensive study on the occurrence of carotenoid-based female pelvic spines and throat ornaments. The field results showed that females, and males, with reddish spines were found in all 17 populations. Specimens of both sexes with conspicuous red spines were found in several of the sites. The pelvic spines of males were more intensely red compared to the females\u2019 spines, and large specimens were more red than small ones. Fish infected with the tapeworm (Schistocephalus solidus) had drabber spines than uninfected fish.

The majority of the questions (74%) were simple in form, with the remainder being multi-part, multifaceted or narrative. Even simple-form questions could, however, have complex interpretations. Fifty four questions were submitted to the search box at the NIMH website. For 32 questions, no answer could be found in the top one to three documents returned. Inadequacies in the search and retrieval technology deployed at websites account for some of the failure to find answers. The nature of consumer questions in mental health also plays a role. A question that has a false presupposition is less likely to have an answer in trusted and vetted sources of information. Consumer questions are also expressed with a degree of specificity that makes the retrieval of relevant information difficult. The significance of this study is that it shows what an analysis of consumer mental-health questions can tell us about consumer information needs and it provides new insight into the difficulties facing consumers looking for answers to their questions in online resources.<\/p>","title-html":"A questions-based investigation of consumer mental-health information","subjects":["Bioinformatics","Cognitive Disorders","Psychiatry and Psychology","Public Health","Human\u2013Computer Interaction"],"identifiers":{"peerj":"867","pubmed":"25870768","pmc":"4393807"},"@context":"http:\/\/static.peerj.com\/context\/citation\/context.json","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ScholarlyArticle","@id":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867","_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.json"},"alternate":{"html":{"type":"text\/html","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.html"},"xml":{"type":"application\/xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.xml"},"pdf":{"type":"application\/pdf","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.pdf"},"rdf":{"type":"application\/rdf+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.rdf"},"ris":{"type":"application\/x-research-info-systems","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.ris"},"bib":{"type":"application\/x-bibtex","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.bib"},"unixref":{"type":"application\/unixref+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.unixref"},"datacite":{"type":"application\/datacite+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.datacite"},"citeproc":{"type":"application\/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/867.citeproc"}}}}

We conducted a controlled experiment to test the effects of four preservation methods of muscle tissue from four species of upper trophic-level reef fish collected from the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Red Grouper Epinephelus morio, Gag Mycteroperca microlepis, Scamp Mycteroperca phenax, and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus).

The use of forceplates and foot-mounted accelerometers readily allows the detection of the foot-on and foot-off events that define a stride. However, when relying on optical methods such as motion capture, there is lack of validated robust, universally applicable stride event detection methods. To date, no method has been validated for movement on a circle, while algorithms are commonly specific to front\/hind limbs or gait. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate kinematic stride segmentation methods applicable to movement on straight line and circle at walk and trot, which exclusively rely on a single, dorsal hoof marker. The advantage of such marker placement is the robustness to marker loss and occlusion. Eight horses walked and trotted on a straight line and in a circle over an array of multiple forceplates. Kinetic events were detected based on the vertical force profile and used as the reference values. Kinematic events were detected based on displacement, velocity or acceleration signals of the dorsal hoof marker depending on the algorithm using (i) defined thresholds associated with derived movement signals and (ii) specific events in the derived movement signals. Method comparison was performed by calculating limits of agreement, accuracy, between-horse precision and within-horse precision based on differences between kinetic and kinematic event. In addition, we examined the effect of force thresholds ranging from 50 to 150 N on the timings of kinetic events. The two approaches resulted in very good and comparable performance: of the 3,074 processed footfall events, 95% of individual foot on and foot off events differed by no more than 26 ms from the kinetic event, with average accuracy between \u221211 and 10 ms and average within- and between horse precision \u22648 ms. While the event-based method may be less likely to suffer from scaling effects, on soft ground the threshold-based method may prove more valuable. While we found that use of velocity thresholds for foot on detection results in biased event estimates for the foot on the inside of the circle at trot, adjusting thresholds for this condition negated the effect. For the final four algorithms, we found no noteworthy bias between conditions or between front- and hind-foot timings. Different force thresholds in the range of 50 to 150 N had the greatest systematic effect on foot-off estimates in the hind limbs (up to on average 16 ms per condition), being greater than the effect on foot-on estimates or foot-off estimates in the forelimbs (up to on average \u00b17 ms per condition).","description-html":"<p>The study of animal movement commonly requires the segmentation of continuous data streams into individual strides.

While clustering of positively selected amino acids by supertyping revealed a single supertype shared by only jungle and carrion crows, a pattern consistent with convergence, the overall phylogenetic patterns we observed suggest that TSP, rather than convergence, explains the interspecific allelic similarity of MHC IIB genes in these species of crows.<\/p>","title-html":"Patterns of evolution of MHC class II genes of crows (<i>Corvus<\/i>) suggest trans-species polymorphism","subjects":["Evolutionary Studies","Genetics","Molecular Biology","Zoology","Immunology"],"identifiers":{"peerj":"853","pubmed":"25802816","pmc":"4369332"},"@context":"http:\/\/static.peerj.com\/context\/citation\/context.json","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ScholarlyArticle","@id":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853","_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.json"},"alternate":{"html":{"type":"text\/html","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.html"},"xml":{"type":"application\/xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.xml"},"pdf":{"type":"application\/pdf","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.pdf"},"rdf":{"type":"application\/rdf+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.rdf"},"ris":{"type":"application\/x-research-info-systems","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.ris"},"bib":{"type":"application\/x-bibtex","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.bib"},"unixref":{"type":"application\/unixref+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.unixref"},"datacite":{"type":"application\/datacite+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.datacite"},"citeproc":{"type":"application\/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/853.citeproc"}}}}

Although complex and repetitive genome segments complicate CNV detection, GROM-RD adjusts for repeat bias and uses a two-pipeline masking approach to detect CNVs in complex and repetitive segments while improving sensitivity in less complicated regions. To overcome a typical weakness of RD methods, GROM-RD employs a CNV search using size-varying overlapping windows to improve breakpoint resolution. We compared our method to two widely used programs based on read depth methods, CNVnator and RDXplorer, and observed improved CNV detection and breakpoint accuracy for GROM-RD.

We found non-uniform variance across distinct GC regions after using existing GC bias correction methods and developed a novel approach to normalize such variance. Although complex and repetitive genome segments complicate CNV detection, GROM-RD adjusts for repeat bias and uses a two-pipeline masking approach to detect CNVs in complex and repetitive segments while improving sensitivity in less complicated regions. To overcome a typical weakness of RD methods, GROM-RD employs a CNV search using size-varying overlapping windows to improve breakpoint resolution. We compared our method to two widely used programs based on read depth methods, CNVnator and RDXplorer, and observed improved CNV detection and breakpoint accuracy for GROM-RD.

In this study, a social group of six zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) could collect PVC tokens and exchange them with researchers for food rewards at one of two locations.

To verify whether listening to classical music has any effect on human transcriptome, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling from the peripheral blood of participants after listening to classical music (n = 48), and after a control study without music exposure (n = 15). As musical experience is known to influence the responses to music, we compared the transcriptional responses of musically experienced and inexperienced participants separately with those of the controls. Comparisons were made based on two subphenotypes of musical experience: musical aptitude and music education. In musically experiencd participants, we observed the differential expression of 45 genes (27 up- and 18 down-regulated) and 97 genes (75 up- and 22 down-regulated) respectively based on subphenotype comparisons (rank product non-parametric statistics, pfp 0.05, >1.2-fold change over time across conditions). Gene ontological overrepresentation analysis (hypergeometric test, FDR < 0.05) revealed that the up-regulated genes are primarily known to be involved in the secretion and transport of dopamine, neuron projection, protein sumoylation, long-term potentiation and dephosphorylation. Down-regulated genes are known to be involved in ATP synthase-coupled proton transport, cytolysis, and positive regulation of caspase, peptidase and endopeptidase activities. One of the most up-regulated genes, alpha-synuclein (SNCA), is located in the best linkage region of musical aptitude on chromosome 4q22.1 and is regulated by GATA2, which is known to be associated with musical aptitude. Several genes reported to regulate song perception and production in songbirds displayed altered activities, suggesting a possible evolutionary conservation of sound perception between species. We observed no significant findings in musically inexperienced participants.","description-html":"<p>Although brain imaging studies have demonstrated that listening to music alters human brain structure and function, the molecular mechanisms mediating those effects remain unknown.

Gene ontological overrepresentation analysis (hypergeometric test, FDR &lt; 0.05) revealed that the up-regulated genes are primarily known to be involved in the secretion and transport of dopamine, neuron projection, protein sumoylation, long-term potentiation and dephosphorylation. Down-regulated genes are known to be involved in ATP synthase-coupled proton transport, cytolysis, and positive regulation of caspase, peptidase and endopeptidase activities. One of the most up-regulated genes, <i>alpha-synuclein<\/i> (<i>SNCA<\/i>), is located in the best linkage region of musical aptitude on chromosome 4q22.1 and is regulated by <i>GATA2<\/i>, which is known to be associated with musical aptitude. Several genes reported to regulate song perception and production in songbirds displayed altered activities, suggesting a possible evolutionary conservation of sound perception between species. We observed no significant findings in musically inexperienced participants.<\/p>","title-html":"The effect of listening to music on human transcriptome","subjects":["Genetics","Genomics"],"identifiers":{"peerj":"830","pubmed":"25789207","pmc":"4362302"},"@context":"http:\/\/static.peerj.com\/context\/citation\/context.json","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/ScholarlyArticle","@id":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830","_links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.json"},"alternate":{"html":{"type":"text\/html","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.html"},"xml":{"type":"application\/xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.xml"},"pdf":{"type":"application\/pdf","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.pdf"},"rdf":{"type":"application\/rdf+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.rdf"},"ris":{"type":"application\/x-research-info-systems","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.ris"},"bib":{"type":"application\/x-bibtex","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.bib"},"unixref":{"type":"application\/unixref+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.unixref"},"datacite":{"type":"application\/datacite+xml","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.datacite"},"citeproc":{"type":"application\/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json","href":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/830.citeproc"}}}}

Establishing health-related causal relationships is a central pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the interdependent non-linearity of biological systems renders causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to disentangle.
