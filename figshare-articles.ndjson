I derive an estimate of the differences in ecological and physiological infant care costs that suggest an order of ascending costs in the wild: Cebuella, Callithrix, Mico, Callimico, Saguinus, and Leontopithecus. I examine the literature on each genus for the most variable traits and evaluate a) where they fall along the continuum of infant care costs according to their reproductive strategies, and b) whether these costs correspond to the ecophysiological estimates of infant care costs. I conclude that infant care costs can provide a unifying explanation for the most variable reproductive traits among callitrichine genera.","total_size":"15.15 KB","owner":{"id":480453,"full_name":"Samuel Diaz-Munoz"},"authors":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Diaz-munoz","id":480453,"full_name":"Samuel Diaz-Munoz"}],"tags":[{"id":46846,"name":"Cooperative Breeding"},{"id":224794,"name":"field work"},{"id":317943,"name":"tamarins"},{"id":2499,"name":"integrative"},{"id":201258,"name":" ecophysiology"},{"id":269955,"name":"mating systems"},{"id":802,"name":"evolution"}],"categories":[{"id":16,"name":"Physiology"},{"id":39,"name":"Ecology"},{"id":159,"name":"Zoology"},{"id":24,"name":"Evolutionary Biology"}],"files":[{"thumb":null,"download_url":"http:\/\/files.figshare.com\/2038601\/README","name":"README","id":2038601,"mime_type":"text\/plain","size":"1 KB"},{"thumb":null,"download_url":"http:\/\/files.figshare.com\/2038600\/callitrichine_data_complete.csv","name":"callitrichine_data_complete.csv","id":2038600,"mime_type":"text\/plain","size":"3 KB"},{"thumb":null,"download_url":"http:\/\/files.figshare.com\/2038602\/code.R","name":"code.R","id":2038602,"mime_type":"text\/plain","size":"12 KB"}],"links":[]}

The idea is to offer an immersive learning\/creative trip addressed to the edu\/school-trip tourism market field, thus comprising hands-on curriculum-linked activities addressed to youth, in particular those involved in the Cultural and Creative sector aged from 15-18 (segment 1) and from 19-25 (segment 2). School-trip tourism, in fact, is nontrivial: approx. 92,9M students make more than 100M day trips and 15-20M overnight trips a year. School-trips are planned by secondary schools all over the year, as well as students from HEIs and ACADs travel mainly for learning purposes. Basing on this particular fact, school-trip tourism can effectively contribute to improve arrivals in low-medium season period, meeting the goals of the Calypso initiative.

Compounds 1\u20133 have similar coordination units and display asymmetry in the degree of planarity of the bridging CuO2Ln fragments, which is unusual for CuII\u2013LnIII\u2013CuII complexes. The geometry of the obtained complexes has been compared to the structural data of other 3d\u20134f\u20133d trinuclear diphenoxo-bridged complexes. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the field-dependent magnetization indicate that the interaction between CuII and LnIII ions is antiferromagnetic for Ln\u00a0=\u00a0Pr (2) and Nd (3), whereas in 1 the CuII\u2013LaIII pairs show no significant interaction, which is in accord with the non-magnetic nature of the ground state for lanthanum(III).","total_size":"551.92 KB","owner":{"id":465068,"full_name":"Taylor Francis"},"authors":[{"first_name":"Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o","last_name":"Beata","id":694311,"full_name":"Beata Crist\u00f3v\u00e3O"},{"first_name":"Miroslaw","last_name":"Barbara","id":694312,"full_name":"Barbara Miroslaw"}],"tags":[{"id":391017,"name":"display asymmetry"},{"id":391016,"name":"H 4L"},{"id":391015,"name":"CuO 2Ln fragments"},{"id":391013,"name":"Cu 2Ln"},{"id":374281,"name":"LnIII ions"},{"id":791,"name":"complex"},{"id":199032,"name":"Ground State"},{"id":84332,"name":"nd"},{"id":1284,"name":"interaction"},{"id":381893,"name":"CuII"},{"id":282123,"name":"coordination units"},{"id":275842,"name":"temperature dependence"},{"id":35189,"name":"trinuclear"}],"categories":[{"id":122,"name":"Mental Health"},{"id":48,"name":"Biological Sciences"},{"id":38,"name":"Chemistry"},{"id":33,"name":"Earth and Environmental Sciences"},{"id":16,"name":"Physiology"},{"id":14,"name":"Molecular Biology"},{"id":13,"name":"Genetics"},{"id":12,"name":"Cell Biology"},{"id":8,"name":"Microbiology"},{"id":6,"name":"Physics"},{"id":4,"name":"Biochemistry"},{"id":1,"name":"Biophysics"}],"files":[{"thumb":"http:\/\/previews.figshare.com\/1919820\/250_1919820.png","download_url":"http:\/\/files.figshare.com\/1919820\/gcoo_a_1022166_sm1025.docx","name":"gcoo_a_1022166_sm1025.docx","id":1919820,"mime_type":"application\/msword","size":"565 KB"}],"links":[]}
